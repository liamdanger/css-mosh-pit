# CSS Mosh Pit

The CSS Zen Garden is a tranquil place where you can create a serene, beautiful CSS layout for a standard set of markup.

The CSS Mosh Pit is a maelstrom of chaotic voices, all clamoring to be heard over the din, all falling to the inexorable forces of entropy.

Basically, everyone gets to modify the CSS for this page at once. In real time. It's a merry shit show.
